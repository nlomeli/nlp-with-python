But a smaller event was, in its way, no less impressive. In a blind taste-testing held in France, the wines of California\u2019s Napa Valley defeated the best the French had to offer \u2014 and all the judges were French! A bottle of the winning American vintage, it is said, now rests on exhibit in the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\u201cBottle Shock\u201d is a charming fictionalized version of the victory, \u201cbased,\u201d as they love to say, \u201con a true story.\u201d Shot in California like \"Sideways\" but set much closer to the earth, it tells the story of a struggling vineyard named Chateau Montelena, deeply in debt with three bank loans. It\u2019s run by the hard-driving Jim Barrett (Bill Pullman), who despairs of his layabout, long-haired son Bo (Chris Pine).\n\nMeanwhile, in Paris, we meet a British wine lover named Steven Spurrier (Alan Rickman), whose tiny wine shop is grandly named \u201cThe Academy of Wine.\u201d We never see a single customer in the shop, only the constant visits of a neighboring travel agent, Maurice (Dennis Farina, in full Chicago accent). Maurice encourages Steven by praising his wines, which he samples freely while passing out business advice.\n\nSpurrier (yes, a real man) has been hearing about the wines of California and has an inspiration: His grand-sounding \u201cacademy\u201d will sponsor a blind taste-test between the wines of the two countries. That he is able to gather a panel of expert judges says much for the confidence of the French, who should have realized it was a dangerous proposition.\n\nIn Napa, we meet two other major players: A pretty summer intern named Sam (Rachael Taylor), and an employee of Jim\u2019s named Gustavo Brambilia\u2014- yes, another real character--is played by Freddy Rodriguez. Gustavo has wine in his bones, if such a thing is possible, and would go on to found a famous vineyard. The two boys raise cash by Gustavo\u2019s (partially true) ability to identify any wine and vintage by tasting it, and of course, they both fall in love with Sam, who lives for the summer in a shack out of The Grapes of Wrath.\n\nThe outcome is predictable; anyone who cares even casually knows the Yanks won, but director milks great entertainment, if not actual suspense, out of the competition. Much of its effect is due to the precise, quietly comic performance by Alan Rickman as Spurrier. \u201cWhy do I hate you?\u201d asks Jim Barrett, who resists the competition. \u201cBecause you think I\u2019m an asshole,\u201d Spurrier replies calmly. \u201cActually, I\u2019m not an asshole. It\u2019s just that I\u2019m British, and, well ... you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nWe see him navigating the back roads of Napa in a rented Gremlin, selecting wines for his competition and getting around U.S. Customs by convincing 26 fellow air travelers to each carry a bottle back for him. That the momentous competition actually took place, that it shook the wine world to its foundations, that it was repeated 20 years later, is a story many people are vaguely familiar with. But \u201cBottle Shock\u201d is more than the story. It is also about people who love their work, care about it with passion and talk about it with knowledge. Did you know that a thirsty, struggling vine produces the best wines? It can\u2019t just sit there sipping water. It has to struggle \u2014 just like Chateau Montelena.\n\nRead the movie\u2019s end credits to find out how the movie fudges a few names, facts and vineyards -- and what happened to Gustavo.", "running_time": 110, "mpaa_rating": "PG-13", "release_year": 2008, "date_published": "2008-08-04", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Indie"], "title": "Bottle Shock (2008)"}
