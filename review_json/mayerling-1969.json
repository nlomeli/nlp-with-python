This is a very long, slow, passive film, and it's going to be difficult to sit through. I guess it's worth it, though, for traditional kinds of reasons.\n\nIt tells a tale out of history. It's about beautiful doomed people. It is played by actors with grace and style: Catherine Deneuve (yes!), Ava Gardner, James Mason -- even Omar Sharif has style for a change. It has magnificent location settings, great scenery and costumes, spellbinding photography and, in short, everything except a story.\n\n\"Mayerling\" is about the final days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. All movies about the final days of empires have got to be filled with brooding irony; it's the custom. \"Mayerling\" broods overmuch. Its characters wander listlessly about Vienna, sighing and reciting bitter epigrams. \"Be quiet,\" Ava Gardner says, \"and after a while you will hear a noise. Perhaps a door closing or a spoon dropping. We are never entirely alone.\" Alas.\n\nThe situation is this. Franz-Joseph (James Mason) rules the empire with little thought for the future. His son (Sharif) complains he has no power and is a stuffed puppet. He falls in love with Catherine Deneuve. But the marriage cannot be because he's already married, for one thing. A royal scandal results. Emissaries in the night tempt Sharif with the idea of revolution.\n\nHe agrees: He will join in revolt against his father and renounce the throne. \"Would you do anything for me?\" he asks Catherine. \"Yes, why?\" she says. \"Because I just have -- for you,\" he replies with brooding irony. No one with an undeveloped appreciation for brooding irony had better see \"Mayerling\" at all.", "running_time": null, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1969, "date_published": "1969-05-06", "genres": null, "title": "Mayerling (1969)"}
