And Parisians are not all colorful intellectuals, bohemians, artists and tradesmen, so authentic they make you feel like a stage American. France, in fact, is not all like France. Parts of it are glossy new architectural enclaves where yuppies meet to chirp and preen. That is the France of Eric Rohmer\u2019s new film, \u201cBoyfriends and Girlfriends.\u201d The movie takes place in a modern suburb of Paris, so close you can sometimes see the Eiffel Tower in the distance, so far away it is almost another country. This is a clean, well-lighted environment, in which all of the fixtures of a Paris neighborhood have been picked up, shaken well, dusted, sterilized, painted and set down again. The sidewalk cafes, for example, have just the right little porcelain sugar bowls and round white chairs. All they lack is a sidewalk.\n\nIn this environment, Rohmer places several young professionals who range in age from, say, 24 to 32. One woman works in a social agency. Another works in a travel bureau. The men have more abstract jobs that require them to venture into Paris itself. But their true home is here in this brand new environment that seems designed to set off their new slacks and sweaters without throwing too much light on their opinions.\n\n\u201cBoyfriends and Girlfriends\u201d is one of a series of \u201cproverbs\u201d that Rohmer has been working through lately, after his earlier series of six \u201cmoral tales\u201d such as \u201cMy Night at Maud\u2019s\u201d and \u201cClaire\u2019s Knee.\u201d The moral tales presented their characters with actual and tricky moral dilemmas (for example, should one act selfishly on a desire to touch Claire\u2019s knee if that indulgence would interfere with Clair\u2019s otherwise happily innocent existence?). The proverbs, on the other hand, are skimpier affairs, lightweight little whimsies designed to illustrate some sort of everyday truth in an ironic way.\n\nThe proverb that inspired \u201cBoyfriends and Girlfriends\u201d is \u201cThe friends of my friends are my friends\u201d (which, in French, was the original title of the movie, and, in English, would make a more intriguing one than \u201cBoyfriends and Girlfriends\u201d).\n\nThe movie is essentially about bad timing. Two young women are friends, not deep lifelong soul sisters, to be sure, but friends. They see a handsome young man. One likes him, the other gets him, and then, in a sense, they trade, with an additional boyfriend and a few other friends thrown into the mixture. All of the permutations are unimportant, because we are not dealing with the heart here, but with fashion.\n\nThere is a sense in which none of these characters can feel deeply, although they can admittedly experience transient periods of weeping and moaning over their cruel fates. That\u2019s because their relationships are based essentially on outward appearances; they choose lovers as fashion accessories. In conversation, they find they have \u201ca lot in common,\u201d but that\u2019s easy to explain: They all hold exactly the same few limited opinions.\n\nWhen one girl thinks she has a boy and another girl gets him, there is a sense of betrayal, all right, but it\u2019s not the kind of passionate betrayal that leads to murder or suicide. It\u2019s the kind of betrayal that leads to dramatic statements like \u201cI\u2019m not ever going to speak to you again!\u201d Rohmer knows exactly what he is doing here. He has no great purpose, but an interesting small one: He wants to observe the everyday behavior of a new class of French person, the young professionals whose values are mostly materialistic, whose ideas have been shaped by popular culture, who do not read much, or think much about politics, or have much depth. By the end of this film you may know his characters better than they will ever know themselves. In \u201cMy Night at Maud\u2019s,\u201d a man sat by the bedside of a woman all night long while they talked and talked and talked. The sad thing about the people in \u201cBoyfriends and Girlfriends,\u201d we sense, is that in such a situation they would have little to talk about. And if the boy actually got into the bed, even less.", "running_time": 102, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1988, "date_published": "1988-09-16", "genres": null, "title": "Boyfriends and Girlfriends (1988)"}
