Lasse Karlsson, a middle-aged farmhand from Sweden, has more modest hopes as he sails with his young son to Denmark in the early years of this century. In Denmark, he says, they will drink coffee in bed on Sunday mornings, and eat roast pork with raisins for Sunday dinner. He cradles his son, Pelle, in his arms as their little passenger vessel noses into a small harbor, where disappointment sets in almost at once.\n\nAlmost everyone on the boat is a Swedish laborer, looking for work. Farmers have turned out to inspect them as if they were cattle.\n\nOne by one, the men are hired, until finally only Lasse and Pelle are left. Nobody wants to hire Lasse (Max von Sydow). He is too old. He has a son. Half-drunk and defiant, he all but forces himself on the last of the farmers, a man named Kongstrup who has a shifty look about him.\n\nLasse and Pelle sit in the farmer\u2019s cart as it passes through fields on its way to their futures.\n\n\u201cPelle the Conqueror\u201d uses this beginning, full of hope and dreams, in an interesting way. Through the seasons that follow during a long year on the Kongstrup farm, the vision somehow stays alive inside Pelle, even though life seems organized to disappoint him. The film begins with one hopeful immigration - Sweden to Denmark - and ends with another, Pelle\u2019s decision to take his chances in the larger world.\n\nLife on the Kongstrup farm is defined by the land, the seasons, and the personalities of the people who live there. The Kongstrups themselves hardly appear for long stretches of time; they live in a big house set aside from the farm buildings, and Mrs. Kongstrup spends her days drinking brandy while her husband chases wenches. He has no shame, not even about the one unfortunate woman who appears at his front door from time to time, their child in her arms.\n\nIn the quarters where the laborers live, life is defined by the sadism of the \u201cManager\u201d (Erik Paaske), a bully who spots weaknesses in his men and exploits them. He is assisted in his cruelty by the \u201cTrainee,\u201d a youth who takes particular pleasure in tormenting Pelle.\n\nThe boy turns to his father for protection, but Lasse is too old and too weary to help. Eventually Pelle makes his own alliances for friendship and protection.\n\n\u201cPelle the Conqueror,\u201d which won the Grand Prix at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival, was adapted by Bille August, whose previous film, \u201cTwist and Shout,\u201d was about teenagers coming of age in the 1960s. In tone and sometimes in visuals, the movie resembles \u201cThe Emigrants\u201d and \u201cThe New Land\u201d (1974), Jan Troell\u2019s two-part epic about Scandinavians who settled in Minnesota. Both films star Max von Sydow, that mighty oak of Swedish cinema, who is unsurpassed at the difficult challenge of appearing not to act, of appearing to be simple and true even in scenes of great complexity.\n\nThe film is a richness of events. There are scenes of punishingly hard work in the fields, under the eye of the Manager. A challenge between the Manager and an independent-minded worker, with tragic results. The intrigue in the big house, where Mrs. Kongstrup exacts a particularly ironic revenge for her husband\u2019s philandering. The heartbreak of a beautiful local girl, who has fallen in love above her station.\n\nThe most touching sequence in the film involves a winter\u2019s romance between Lasse and a sailor\u2019s wife who lives in a cottage near the sea.\n\nPelle is the first to meet the woman, whose husband has been missing for years and is presumed dead. He introduces his father to her, and the two people take a liking to one another that is practical as well as sentimental. There is a scene of great delicacy and sensible realism, in which they evaluate their resources and decide they should live together, and afterwards Lasse is able to suggest with a smile to his son that they might soon be having coffee in bed on Sundays after all.\n\nVon Sydow\u2019s work in the film has been honored with an Academy Award nomination for best actor, well deserved, particularly after a distinguished career in which he stood at the center of many of Ingmar Bergman\u2019s greatest films (\u201cThe Virgin Spring,\u201d \u201cThe Seventh Seal\u201d). But there is not a bad performance in the movie, and the newcomer, Pelle Hvenegaard, never steps wrong in the title role (there is poetic justice in the fact that he actually was named after the novel that inspired this movie). It is Pelle, not Lasse, who is really at the center of the movie, which begins when he follows his father\u2019s dream, and ends as he realizes he must follow his own.", "running_time": 138, "mpaa_rating": null, "release_year": 1989, "date_published": "1989-03-03", "genres": ["Drama", "Foreign"], "title": "Pelle the Conqueror (1989)"}
