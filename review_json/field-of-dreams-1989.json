The voice speaks again, soft and confidential: \u201cIf you build it, he will come.\u201d Sometimes you can get too much sun, out there in a hot Iowa cornfield in the middle of the season. But this isn\u2019t a case of sunstroke.\n\nUp until the farmer starts hearing voices, \u201cField of Dreams\u201d is a completely sensible film about a young couple who want to run a family farm in Iowa. Ray and Annie Kinsella (Kevin Costner and Amy Madigan) have tested the fast track and had enough of it, and they enjoy sitting on the porch and listening to the grass grow. When the voice speaks for the first time, the farmer is baffled, and so was I: Could this be one of those religious pictures where a voice tells the humble farmer where to build the cathedral? \n\nIt\u2019s a religious picture, all right, but the religion is baseball. And when he doesn\u2019t understand the spoken message, Ray is granted a vision of a baseball diamond, right there in his cornfield.\n\nIf he builds it, the voice seems to promise, Joe Jackson will come and play on it - Shoeless Joe, who was a member of the infamous 1919 Black Sox team but protested until the day he died that he played the best he could.\n\nAs \u201cField of Dreams\u201d developed this fantasy, I found myself being willingly drawn into it. Movies are often so timid these days, so afraid to take flights of the imagination, that there is something grand and brave about a movie where a voice tells a farmer to build a baseball diamond so that Shoeless Joe Jackson can materialize out of the cornfield and hit a few fly balls. This is the kind of movie Frank Capra might have directed, and James Stewart might have starred in -- a movie about dreams.\n\nIt is important not to tell too much about the plot. (I\u2019m grateful I knew nothing about the movie when I went to see it, but the ads give away the Shoeless Joe angle.) Let it be said that Annie supports her husband\u2019s vision, and that he finds it necessary to travel east to Boston so that he can enlist the support of a famous writer (James Earl Jones) who has disappeared from sight, and north to Minnesota to talk to what remains of a doctor (Burt Lancaster) who never got the chance to play with the pros.\n\nThe movie sensibly never tries to make the slightest explanation for the strange events that happen after the diamond is constructed.\n\nThere is, of course, the usual business about how the bank thinks the farmer has gone haywire and wants to foreclose on his mortgage (the Capra and Stewart movies always had evil bankers in them). But there is not a corny, stupid payoff at the end. Instead, the movie depends on a poetic vision to make its point.\n\nThe director, Phil Alden Robinson, and the writer, W. P. Kinsella, are dealing with stuff that\u2019s close to the heart (it can\u2019t be a coincidence that the author and the hero have the same last name).\n\nThey love baseball, and they think it stands for an earlier, simpler time when professional sports were still games and not industries.\n\nThere is a speech in this movie about baseball that is so simple and true that it is heartbreaking. And the whole attitude toward the players reflects that attitude. Why do they come back from the great beyond and play in this cornfield? Not to make any kind of vast, earthshattering statement, but simply to hit a few and field a few, and remind us of a good and innocent time.\n\nIt is very tricky to act in a movie like this; there is always the danger of seeming ridiculous. Costner and Madigan create such a grounded, believable married couple that one of the themes of the movie is the way love means sharing your loved one\u2019s dreams. Jones and Lancaster create small, sharp character portraits - two older men who have taken the paths life offered them, but never forgotten what baseball represented to them in their youth.\n\n\u201cField of Dreams\u201d will not appeal to grinches and grouches and realists. It is a delicate movie, a fragile construction of one goofy fantasy after another. But it has the courage to be about exactly what it promises. \u201cIf you build it, he will come.\u201d And he does. In a baseball movie named \u201cThe Natural,\u201d the hero seemed almost messianic.\n\n\u201cField of Dreams\u201d has a more modest aim. The ghost of Shoeless Joe does not come back to save the world. He simply wants to answer that wounded cry that has become a baseball legend: \u201cSay it ain\u2019t so, Joe!\u201d And the answer is, it ain\u2019t.", "running_time": 107, "mpaa_rating": "PG", "release_year": 1989, "date_published": "1989-04-21", "genres": ["Drama", "Family", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Sports Film"], "title": "Field of Dreams (1989)"}
