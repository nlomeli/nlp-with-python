No, but he might pawn it. Paul Giamatti is struggling through rehearsals for Chekhov\u2019s \u201cUncle Vanya\u201d and finds the role is haunting every aspect of his life. His soul is weighed down, it tortures him, it makes his wife miserable. He sees an article in the New Yorker about a new trend: People are having their souls extracted for a time, to lighten the burden.\n\nThe man who performs this service is Dr. Flintstein, whose Soul Storage service will remove the soul (or 95 percent of it, anyway) and hold it in cold storage. As played by a droll David Strathairn, whose own soul seems in storage for this character, Flintstein makes his service sound perfectly routine. He\u2019s the type of medical professional who focuses on the procedure and not the patient. Giamatti, playing an actor named after himself, has some questions, as would we all, but he signs up.\n\n\u201cCold Souls\u201d is a demonstration of the principle that it is always wise to seek a second opinion. The movie is a first feature written and directed by Sophie Barthes, whose previous film was a short about a middle-aged condom tester who considers buying a box labeled \u201cHappiness\u201d at the drugstore. Clearly this is a filmmaker who would enjoy having dinner with Charlie Kaufman. Perhaps inspired by Kaufman\u2019s screenplay for \u201cBeing John Malkovich,\u201d she also credits Dead Souls, the novel by Gogol about a Russian landowner who buys up the souls of his serfs.\n\nGogol was writing satire, and so is Barthes. We hope that medical intervention can help us do what we cannot do on our own: Focus better, look younger, lose weight, cheer up, be smarter. If only it were as simple as taking a pill. Or, in Giamatti\u2019s case, lying on his back to be inserted into a machine looking uncannily like a pregnant MRI scanner.\n\nHis soul is successfully extracted and kept in an airtight canister. He\u2019s allowed to see it. It has the size and appearance of a chickpea. Lightened of the burden, he becomes a different actor: easygoing, confident, upbeat, energetic \u2014 and awful. Rehearsals are a disaster, and he returns to Flintstein, demanding his old soul back.\n\nThis is not easily done, for reasons involving Nina (Dina Korzun), a sexy Russian courier in the black market for souls. A Russian soul is made available to Giamatti, with alarming results. All of this is dealt with in the only way that will possibly work, which is to say, with very straight faces. The material could be approached as a madcap comedy, but it\u2019s funnier this way, as a neurotic, self-centered actor goes through even more anguish than Chekhov ordinarily calls for.\n\nI suppose \u201cCold Souls\u201d is technically science fiction. There\u2019s a subset involving a world just like the one we inhabit, with only one element changed. In an era of Frankenscience, \u201cCold Souls\u201d objectifies all the new age emoting about the soul and inserts it into the medical-care system. Certainly if you have enough money to sidestep your insurance company, a great many cutting-edge treatments are available. And soul extraction is not such a stretch when you reflect that personality destruction, in the form of a pre-frontal lobotomy, was for many years medically respectable. Insert an ice pick just so, and your worries are over.\n\nI enjoy movies like this, which play with the logical consequences of an idea. Barthes takes her notion and runs with it, and Giamatti and Strathairn follow fearlessly. The movie is rather evocative about the way we govern ourselves from the inside out. One of Nina\u2019s problems is that she has picked up little pieces from the souls of all other people she has carried.
